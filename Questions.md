Questions
=========

-   Normality-tests: They seem to always reject normality, presumably because
    of rather high N (100+). When is which preferable?

    -   Shapiro-Wilk
    -   D'agostino-Pearson
    -   KS
    -   ...others?
-   Can we ignore / somehow explain away their results and still use *T*-test
    instead of *U*-test?

-   Can we aggregate Burger results over all Tasks just to find the point of
    intersection, even if there are significant differences in between the
    burger tasks?
