# Questions

-   Normality-tests: They seem to always reject normality, presumably because
    of rather high N (100+). When is which preferable?

    -   Shapiro-Wilk
    -   D'agostino-Pearson
    -   KS
    -   ...others?


-   Can we ignore / somehow explain away their results and still use *T*-test
    instead of *U*-test?

-   Can we aggregate Burger results over all Tasks just to find the point of
    intersection, even if there are significant differences in between the
    burger tasks?

-   What to do, when everything is significant?

-   Are the data from a 7-Likert-scale only ordinal? Hence, can we only apply
    a Mann-Whitney-U test and NOT a t-test and also only report median and mean?

-   For effectiveness, we have only binary data (minimal number of page changes
    needed or more). report mode or relative frequencies each only?

-   what should the granularity of the reportated data be? For example, how to
    categorize students' subjects? What conditional frequencies to report, e.g.
    fraction of android users among female participants?

-   how to measure the effect size for chi-square-tests?
