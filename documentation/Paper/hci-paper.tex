\begin{abstract}
  For several years, the swipe gesture has been a very-well established way to navigate among adjacent pages on websites as well as in native
  apps on a mobile device. The users appreciate its ease and its comfort of use. However, it can only be applied in scenarios where
  the content is provided in a sequential way, e.g.\ in a picture gallery, in an e-book reader, or when filling in a form. In this paper, we
  examine the swipe gesture's suitability for navigating through a set of questions in an e-learning app. Although typically the user progresses
  through the questions sequentially, it is a common case that they want to revise their answers later due to a change of mind or a missunderstanding
  of the question, for example. We conjecture that navigating back using swipe gestures is unsatisfactory and time-costly as the distance in pages
  increases. In order to research this question, we conduct a study in which we compare the use of swipe gestures to the use of the also
  well-established hamburger menu. We design tasks that capture the use cases described above. We alter the distance in pages
  that has to be covered in order to complete the task. For each task, we measure the efficiency. Furthermore, we assess the user satisfaction through a questionnaire. We expect
  both measures to be independent of the distance when the menu is used. When the swipe gesture is used, however, we expect both measures to decrease
  as the distance increases. We suspect that the swipe gestures do better than the menu when the distance is small, but we also think that this relation flips at a number of pages that is realistic for e-learning apps. Hence, the results of our study are of practical importance.

\section{Introduction}
Due to the availability of mobile internet connection and the establishment of
smartphones for the masses, e-learning applications have become more and more relevant in recent years.  In theory, the promise is that students can study anywhere at any time. However, as for any kind of application, a practical barrier is the usability of such educational application.
\begin{figure}[h]
	\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{drivinglicense.png}
	\caption{Mobile application 'Fahren Lernen Max'}
	\label{fig:fahren_lernen}
\end{figure}
For several years, the swipe gesture has been a very well-established way to
navigate among adjacent pages on websites as well as in native applications on a mobile device (Apps). The users appreciate its ease and comfort of use. However,
it can only be applied in scenarios where the content is provided in a
sequential way, e.g.\ in a picture gallery, in an e-book reader, or when
filling in a form. In this paper, we examine the swipe gesture's suitability
for navigating through a set of questions in an e-learning apps.
\begin{figure*}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{pics/screenshots/sequence}
	\caption{Hamburger navigation sequence}
	\label{fig:sequence}
\end{figure*}
Although typically the user progresses through the questions sequentially, it is a
common case that they want to revise their answers later due to a change of
mind or a misunderstanding of the question, for example. A case that applies very
well to this scenario is the theory test that has to be passed in order to obtain
a driving license in Germany. It consists of a relatively large number of questions and it's common practice to prepare for this examination by taking several exemplary tests. For example, consider Figure \ref{fig:fahren_lernen} which displays a screenshot of the
mobile application 'Fahren Lernen Max'. It displays the typical environment that
is also used for the actual exam. Questions are ordered sequentially, but the examinees
may answer them in any order. During examinations, it is common that some questions are
skipped and returned to at some later point.

In the example of this application, navigation between questions can be done via menu at the bottom of the screen in any direction or via button 'Weiter' only forward. 
Our goal is to find a generalizable statement about what navigation methods makes sense in these scenarios. 
We conjecture that navigating backward using swipe gestures is unsatisfactory and time-costly as the distance in pages increases. 
In order to research this question, we conduct a study in which we compare the use of swipe gestures to the use of the also well-established hamburger menu. 
\todo{kind of need to emphasize that this is some kind of context free study, hence our study design} 
This kind of navigation is mostly represent by three horizontally lines on the left or right upper corner of the screen. 
By touching the hamburger button a menu appears at the side of the screen.
We analyze the common three dependent variables efficiency, satisfaction, and effectiveness, while varying the distance $d$.
It seems reasonable to conjecture
that for very small distances swipe gestures are superior to the hamburger
menu. Because the number of swipes increases proportionally with the distance, the time required can be expected to increase 
proportionally as well. However, when the distance increases, the hamburger menu
may have an advantage because one can directly select the desired page. Corresponding to this conjecture we examine the distances $d = 2, 5, 8, 11, 14$ and
expect the relation between distance and the independent variables as indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:expectation}.
\begin{figure}
	\caption{Expected behavior of dependent variable (y-axis) depending on the distance (x-axis) when using a menu (green line) and when using swipe gestures (blue line)}
	\resizebox{\columnwidth}{!}{
		\includegraphics{expectation.png}\label{fig:expectation}
	}
\end{figure}
The figure presumes an intercept point between the lines to exist. Corresponding to our conjecture that the swipe gestures are superior for very small distances and the hamburger menu's superiority
becomes apparent for large distances, we $d = 5, 10, 15, 20, 25$ as concrete
values for $d$. Our experiment results partly confirm this hypothesis. In detail, our main results are the following:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \todo{main results!}
\end{itemize}
The results of our research give important insight into the usability of
different navigation methods, potentially leading to guidelines for the design
of future e-learning apps.
\section{Apparatus}
In order to simulate the scenarios of jumping from one question to another, we develop a series of treasure hunt like tasks. Here, the goal is to find the treasure which is hidden behind a door. A door is represented by a page. The application was developed for Android devices. We have used two Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 with Android 4.4.2 for our data collection.

First of all an initial page containing the identification number of the participant is shown so the task can be linked to the demographic questionnaire at the very end. Starting at the first page, an instruction displayed on the bottom of the screen guides the participant to the next one by exactly telling them the number of the next door. Now the participant has the possibility to navigate to the next door by swiping left or right, or using the hamburger menu (Figure \ref{fig:sequence}) on the upper left corner. The navigation method depends on the group in which they are located. When the participant has open the respective door, the next instruction is displayed. The distance $d$ to cover from one door to another is always about the same ($d \pm 1$\textit{, see Section \ref{sec:task}}) within the same task. However, the distances differ for different tasks. Consider the example in Figure \ref{fig:jump} which has distance of two. The arrows indicate the door to open in the next step and the arrow captions show the jump distance. Hence, the sequence of doors to open in order to reach the treasure is 2, 4, 1, 3, 5, 6.
\begin{figure}

	\includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{pics/jump}

	\includegraphics[width=0.475\textwidth]{pics/screenshots/global3-cut}
	\label{fig:between_questionnaire}
	\caption{Between questionnaire}
\end{figure}
The tasks cannot be failed to be completed because there is no way to open the doors in the wrong order. The participant has to complete a training set and five task sets. Every set consists of five jumping instructions. After each set the participant has to answer two questions (see Section \ref{sec:measurements}) and at the very end there will be a questionnaire of four questions.

\section{Evaluation Design}
\subsection{Procedure}
For our study, we decided for a between-group design for two reasons. First,
when solving the tasks with the second type, the test persons might rate their
satisfaction more drastically, as they are biased from having solved the tasks
with the respective other navigation method. Secondly, in order to avoid an
extreme learning effect, the tasks for swipe gesture navigation and menu
navigation would have to be distinct if a within-group design were used. This
should be avoided to ensure comparability. The participants are assigned to
each group randomly (at uniform) by employing the random number generator of
the respective android device.

The entire flow for one participant is as follows: First, the participant is explained
the purpose of the study (evaluation of navigation methods on mobile (touch)-devices) and the
type of task to solve (navigation through app). After completing an informed consent form, a unique
identifier is generated and handed over to the participant alongside contact information. Since often students
stay in the dining hall in groups, the participant is separated from the group in order to avoid distraction. 
Before the actual experiment starts, the participant completes a training task during which the goal, the
different layout items, and the navigation are explained. Before finishing the questionnaire for the training
task, the participant is informed that the experiment will start and is asked to focus on the tasks. When they have
finished, the last step for them is to provide demographical data age, gender, profession (including field of study),
and whether they own a smartphone with an Android operating system, a different operating system, or no smartphone.

\subsection{Participants}
Since our target scenario is an application used during examinations,
a typical user of such an application is a university student. Hence, the participants were acquisited in a field study conducted in an academic context, namely the dining hall of Christian-Albrechts-University in Kiel. The participants are representative for all students as the statistics show: In total, there are $N = 50$ participants. All of them are students and the most common courses are: economic computer science (12 \%), agricultural sciences (10 \%), mathematics (8 \%), psychology (8 \%) and economics (6 \%). For the entire distribution consider table \ref{tab:course}. The participants split up into 42 \% male and 58 \% female. The average age is 24.1 (SD: 2.9), 
with values between 20 and 35. 
All but one of the participants own a
smartphone, 75.51 \% of which run Android. This indicates that we may assume good knowledge
of how to handle the device used in our experiment.
The participants signed an informed consent form before the start of the experiment. After
finishing the experiment, they were rewarded with sweets or fruits.

\subsection{Tasks}
\label{sec:task}
During task creation, we faced several design issues: In order to avoid learning effects and for the results to generalize better, 
the sequence should require both forward- and backward-jumps. This raises the problem of collisions, that is, a door is visited twice, which
should also be avoided due to a learning effect. Hence, it is not possible to always have the exact same distance from one door to the
next in the sequence without collisions, but instead they have to differ slighly. However, it is always possible to create a non-colliding sequence of
length five by using distances $d$ three times and distances $d - 1$ and $d + 1$ once each. Hence, on average we have a distance of $d$. 
Furthermore, the distances being limited to two neighbored values, it is reasonable to assume negligible
impact on the experiments outcomes in terms of user-satisfaction and time.

To further reduce any bias of learning effects
the concrete permutation of tasks is generated by subsequently drawing
(uniformly at random, without returning) from the remaining tasks.

For the concrete tasks, please see the appendix. 
\todo{All tasks should always have the same number of doors (although the jump distances remain different)}
\subsection{Measurements}\label{chap:measurements}
\label{sec:measurements}
We aim to measure the common three dependent variables efficiency, satisfaction, and effectiveness of each of the two navigation methods.
\paragraph{Effectiveness}
During the experiment, the application tracks how often the page is changed by the user, that is by either swiping or selecting a different page in the menu. 
Given some task that requires 5 jumps, where the distances to cover in the jumps are given as $d_i, 1 \leq i \leq 5$, let $n_{interactions_i}$ be the number
of page changes by the user for jump $i$.
The optimal number $n_{opt_i}$ of
page changes required equals $1$ for the burger menu navigation and $d_1$ for the swipe gesture navigation. As a measure of 
effectiveness, we measure in how many of the jumps unnecessary page changes were made, that is, the effectiveness for a task
equals $\frac{|\{i \in \{1,\ldots,5\} | n_{interactions_i} = n_{opt_i} \}|}{5}$.
\paragraph{Efficiency} For the efficiency, we calculate the effectiveness of a task divided by the time 
required to complete the task in seconds. We start measuring the time at the point
when the first instruction is displayed and stop when the last door is opened.
\paragraph{Satisfaction}
In order to assess the user satisfaction depending on the distance, after each task, the user is asked to estimate their
agreement on two statements concerning the task. The statements are the following.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item 'I was able to solve the task well.' (in German: 'Ich konnte die Aufgabe gut loesen.')
  \item 'Achieving the goal was too intricate.' (in German: 'Die Erreichung des Ziels war mir zu umstaendlich.')
\end{enumerate}
The rating scale follows the common 7-likert-scale from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (7). \todo{Need to justify why 7?}
The first statement will be used to quantify whether the participants have understood the task and how to solve it. The second statement will
be used to quantify the participant's satisfaction with the navigation method.
After all tasks were completed, the participant also rates these statements that aim to assess the overall experience throughout the experiment.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item 'The environment during working on the tasks was disturbing.' (German: 'Die Umgebung hat mich beim Bearbeiten der Aufgaben gestoert.')
  \item 'The duration of the experiment was too high.' (German: 'Die Dauer des Experiments war mir zu hoch.')
  \item 'Handling the device was intricate.' (German: 'Die Bedienung des Geraets war mir zu umstaendlich.')
  \item 'The type of navigation was appealing to me.' (German: 'Die Art der Navigation hat mir zugesagt.')
\end{enumerate}
Question (1) and (2) serve the purposes to check whether the quality the experiment's results is impaired due to the lack of a laboratory environment or
due to participants' fatigue, respectively. \todo{What is question (3) good for?} Question (4) directly assesses the overall satisfaction with the navigation method.
\todo{Why is final question (4) different to task question (2)?}
\section{Evaluation Results}
In this section, we formalize our hypotheses, explain our procedure and notations for testing the hypotheses, conduct a retrospective power analysis and finally, present both descriptive statistics
and test statistics for each distance, navigation method, and dependent variable. In the end, we present further statistics related to our experiment.

\subsection{Hypotheses}
Let $d$ be the distance in pages to be covered when navigating in a sequence of pages. We formulate the following $H_0$ hypotheses, using the notions
of effectiveness, user satisfaction and efficiency presented in Section \ref{chap:measurements}:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Null hypothesis $H_0^{(efficiency)}$ for efficiency:
	There is no difference between swipe gestures and hamburger menu in the
	time required to navigate over a distance of $d$ pages.
	\item Null hypothesis $H_0^{(effectiveness)}$ for effectiveness: There is no
	difference in effectiveness between swipe gestures and hamburger menu
	when navigating over a distance of $d$ pages.
	\item Null hypothesis $H_0^{(satisfaction)}$ for user satisfaction: There is no
	difference in user satisfaction between swipe gestures and hamburger menu
	when navigating over a distance of $d$ pages.
\end{enumerate}

In fact, we test these hypotheses for different values of $d = 2, 5, 8, 11, 14$, hence, we
examine two independent variables: navigation method and distance.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Testing procedure}
Our main focus in this research is on comparing the two navigation methods when the distance is equal.
The results for all independent variables as introduced in Chapter \ref{chap:measurements} are shown in Table \ref{fig:burger-vs-swipe}. Recall that the
satisfaction is quantified through task question (2). For additional results please see the Appendix.
In order to test for significant differences in any of the independent variables, we first apply a Shapiro–Wilk test to 
test for normality and apply Welch's t-test (marked with *) if the Shapiro-Wilk-test does not reject for either of the groups.
In the case of a t-test, we report the following data in this order: $t$ value, significance level $p$, Cohen's $d$ as a measure of effect size, and the degrees of
freedom $df$. 
The degrees of freedom is \ldots in all cases where a t-test is applied. \todo{verify: is it always the same?}.
In the case where the test for normality fails, we apply a Mann-Whitney-U test (marked with ~), in which case z value, significance level p, and 
the rank-biserial correlation, denoted as r, are provided.

For all our computational analyses, we used the scipy.stats package for Python.
\todo{When you have for example p = 0.199\ldots999, how do you report it? p < 0.2? p $\approx$ 0.2?}

\end{tabular}}
\end{table}
\subsection{Power Analysis}
As already suggested in the introduction, preliminary to conducting the study, we had expected to find strong differences between swipe navigations and menu navigation, that is,
we expected to find significances with an effect size of $d \geq .8$.
Furthermore, we assumed normally distributed data with about equal variances, so using Student's t-tests would be adequate. Hence, in order to achieve statistical power of .8 in a 
two-sided two sample Student's t-test, the number 
of participants should be 25 per group. For this reason we aimed for 50 participants in total. In \todo{number x out of number y cases}, we found the data to be normally distributed and
very often we find large effect sizes (\todo{how often?}). However, because we didn't find the variances to always be equal and because it is discouraged in the literature to
choose between Student's and Welch's t-test per case\todo{ref}, we decided to constantly use Welch's t-test.
\subsection{Results for dependent variables}
\subsubsection{Effectiveness}
Overall, the average effectiveness of the burger menu and swipe gestures are .98 (SD: 0.063) and .93 (SD: 0.106), respectively. For burger menu navigation, 
Table \ref{fig:descriptive-effectiveness} shows that the error rates were slightly lower for task 1 and task 5 than for the others. However, the differences
are not significant (see Appendix) \todo{can we refer to appendix in this way? Seems a little bit like cheating. Maybe in the end there will be enough space to put the 
table here.}. For the swipe navigation, the error rate of task 1 is lower than the error rates of all the other
tasks, which is significant (see Appendix \todo{again, is it ok like this?}).
The other distances do not differ significantly from each other. When
comparing both navigation methods to each other, burger menu navigation yields a higher effectiveness than swipe in any case.
The differences are significant for tasks 3, 4, and 5,
but not for tasks 1 and 2.

\subsubsection{Efficiency}
Averaged over all tasks, burger menu navigation (0.223 (SD: 0.05)) is slightly more efficient than swipe navigation (0.216 (SD: 0.1)). Looking at the
development of the means depending on the tasks shown in Table \ref{fig:descriptive-efficiency}, it can be seen that swipe is very efficient compared to burger for small distances (task 1 and 2), 
but also that the efficiency decreases rapidly. The burger's efficiency also decreases (almost) constantly as the distance increases, but at a smaller rate, so that it is more efficient than swipe
in tasks 3, 4, and 5. Except for task 2, these reported differences between the navigation methods are significant (see Table \ref{fig:burger-vs-swipe}). The effect sizes are mostly large and
increase drastically from task 3 to 5.

\end{tabular}}
\end{table}
\subsubsection{Satisfaction}
The average rating of task question 2, our main measurement for the user's satisfaction with the navigation method, is 1.89 (SD: 1.809) for the burger menu group and 2.86 (SD: 2.13)
for the swipe gesture group, which indicates that the participants perceived the burger menu to be more convenient. This matches the results from final question (4) 
where the burger menu and swipe gestures yield an average rating of 5.14  (SD: 1.67) and 4.5 (SD: 1.453), respectively.
See Table \ref{fig:descriptive-satisfaction} for the statistics of individual tasks. While the satisfaction with swipe navigation has the tendency to increase as the distance increases,
the satisfaction with the burger menu navigation does not show such a tendency. In any case, the burger menu generates higher satisfaction than swipe navigation. The differences are 
significant for all tasks except task 1, which is shown in Table \ref{fig:burger-vs-swipe}. The effect size is below .4 in any case.

\subsection{Other results}
We look into
the results of the questionnaires that are designed to check the validity of our study's design. Task question (1) was rated with
6.91 on average (SD: 0.4) on average in the burger group and 6.84 (SD: 0.46) on average in the swipe group. The lowest rankings were
4 and 5, respectively.
Final question (1) was rated with on average 1.52 (SD: 1.182) for swipe. In total, three participants rated
it with four or more, one out of which rated it with 7. The overall mean of final question (2) was 1.92 (SD: 1.496), 9 of the participants rated it
with 4 or higher. In final question (3) there is a noticable difference between the rating for the burger menu group (1.22 (SD: 0.429)) and the swipe group
(1.75 (SD: 1.378)). Testing with a Mann Whitney U test, the difference does not show significance, z = 255.5, \emph{p}=0.10, d = 0.171. The highest rating was 7
and in total three participants rated with 4 or higher.
\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Main findings}
\paragraph{Effectiveness}
The way we defined effectiveness, burger menu navigation is never worse than swipe navigation, for large distances it is even significantly better. However,
traditionally, effectiveness measures if users complete a task correctly. In our tasks, there is no right or wrong. Here, effectiveness rather measures 
how precisely a participant navigates through the set of pages. In an exam scenario as described in the introduction, a user rather cares about
how fast he can move through between pages. Clearly, making a navigation error affects the experience for the user differently depending on the navigation method.
While a misclick in the burger menu always requires the user to perform twice as many interactions as in the optimal case to reach the goal, an accidental
swiping mistake only requires one additional swipe to correct it. This may affect both the speed and the user satisfaction differently for each navigation method.
These considerations make the results difficult to interprete. On top of that, the effect sizes are rather small which allows only vague practical implications
from the results.
\paragraph{Efficiency}
The test results indicate clear superiority of swipe gestures in terms of efficiency when the distance is small. On the other hand, there is good evidence that
this relation indeed flips as the distance increases, favoring burger menu navigation for distances larger than 8. This supports the hypothesized behavior. However,
it remains unclear whether the efficiency is independent of the distance. During the experiments we observed that, given the device's dispay size and the layout of
the app, the menu displayed a range of 30 items. Hence, in task 5 where the average distance is 14, a participant is required to scroll within the menu by one item.
This raises the question how the dependent variables behave when the distances are even larger than the ones investigated in this study.
\paragraph{Satisfaction}
As expected, the participants perceived navigation with burger menu significantly less intricate when the distance grows. 
On the other hand, the effect size is rather low and a significant superiority of swipe navigation could not be shown for very small distances. Quite the contrary,
on average the burger menu navigation was perceived less intricate even for these very small distances. This stands in contrast to oral and written statements made by some
participants in the burger group. They were missing swipe gestures in order to simplify navigation further. One reason for this contradiction could be that the
evaluation method used in this study is not appropriate to capture the user satisfaction. On the other hand, since for small distances the differences were not significant, there
is a reasonable chance that in a repeat of the experiment this contradiction may not appear again.
\subsection{Study Design Validation}
The results for task question (1) suggest, that the participants did not feel overstrained by the complexity of the tasks. The results of the person who indicated large
distraction from the environment did not stand out in particular. However, 18\% felt the study was relatively long (rated 4 or more at final question (2)). Hence, there is a chance
that these participants became tired or bored at some point during the experiment. The whole process required up to ten minutes. The study could only have been shortened by
reducing the number of tasks, but without a sufficient range of distances, finding the key results for navigation in a page view would be very difficult. 
During answering the final questionnaire, a participant remarked his confusion about the difference in meaning between question (3) and (4). The relatively large difference
between the swipe and the burger group may also be understood as indication that participants grasped both questions in a similar way.  
However, as the difference is not significant, we will assume that the question was understood correctly by most participants and did not lead to too much confusion.
Overall, we think that we were able to eliminate some of the major potential threats to the study's validity. 
\subsection{Summary}
Overall, in terms of efficiency, the presumed intercept point before which swipe navigation and after which burger menu navigation is better was indeed found at 
distance 5. The results for satisfaction and effectiveness support this hypothesis in so far that the differences before that point are not significant. It should further
be taken into account that these two measurements are more difficult to assess than effeciency which mainly depends on the time required to complete the task. Future work
should take a closer look at approaches to capture satisfaction. In order to understand the value of effectiveness better, a systematical investigation of how users perceive
a navigation error depending on the navigation method would also be interesting.

It should further be kept in mind that this study was designed for a very specific context that was discussed in the introduction. The navigation behavior that was required
when conducting the tasks will not apply to the common case. However, as discussed, we believe that adequate application scenarios will become more frequent in the future. 
Therefore, as a practical implication of this work, we would like to give UI designers who plan to use a page view in scenarios similar to the discussed ones
to consider the following recommendation cautiously:
\begin{itemize}
  \item if the design of the application allows it, including both burger menu and swipe navigation methods is beneficiary
  \item if there are more than 5 pages, allowing for burger menu navigation or a similar navigation method is strongly recommended
\end{itemize}
\section{Related Work}
During the last years the usage of mobile devices has increased largely. According to a study from the Pew Research Center
the number of Americans that owned a tablet in 2015 was about 45\%, which is roughly ten times more as in 2010 (4\%). One reason
for this development could be that touch gestures are far easier to comprehend. Therefore, mobile devices become available for every generation. While in general older adults are slower in completing tasks with desktop and mouse compared to younger adults, the use of touch gestures has reduced that gap. The use of a touch screen resulted in a significant movement time reduction by 35\% for older adults. Younger adults still had a movement time reduction of 16\% (Findlater
et al. 2013).\\ To further increase the user experience it is necessary to compare the different gestures as well as the menu elements, like we compare the swipe gesture with the hamburger menu given a specific task. We were able to detect differences between the two navigational methods regarding the time needed to fullfill a task and the user satisfaction given a specific task.\\ Diefenbach et al. compared the usability of manipulative touch gestures to that of an established interaction style based on buttons and menus and indicated a negative influence of gestures when an application is used the first time. They also stated that new gestures are learned in a shorter time span than expected, which might explain the movement time reduction pointed out by Findlater
et al. We can confirm that our participants were as well fast in learning and using the gestures, but since our navigational methods are very simple one has to be careful with a generalization.

\todo{begin: MERGE WITH ABOVE}
Consider the normally distributed random variables $X_d$ with means $\bar x$ and
variances $\sigma_x^2$ being the time required for traveling $d$ pages using Hamburger
Menu navigation.
We hypothize that
\begin{align*}
	H_{0, \text{burger}}: \bar x_0 = \bar x_1 = \cdots = \bar x_d
\end{align*}
% is anova capable of doing reverse test with \not= as H_0?
Since we can assume equal variances,
we evaluate the hypothesis using {ANOVA}.
In case we do not find significant differences, we can use the overall mean
$\bar x$ for comparision with the Swipe navigation. 
We consider normally
distributed random variables $Y_d$ with means $\bar y_d$ and variances $\sigma_{y,d}^2$ as the
time required for traveling $d$ pages using Swipe navigation. 
After asserting
that analogous hypothesis for Swipe navigation fails,
\begin{align*}
	H_{0, \text{swipe}}: \bar y_0 = \bar y_1= \cdots = \bar y_d
\end{align*}
we continue with comparing the means $\bar y_d$ of Swipe navigation to the
mean $\bar x$ of Hamburger Menu navigation.  In order to find the distance
$d$, for which the required time with Swipe navigation exceeds the required
time with Hamburger Menu navigation, we formulate the following hypotheses:
\begin{align*}
	H_{0,d} : \bar y_d = \bar x \;\forall d
\end{align*}
\todo{end, reread.\ this might be moved to a later section, since it is
	quite technical already}
